            <p> At the start of this module, I had near to none experience of coding. The only knowledge I had of coding was what I have already googled
                in my spare time during my year off of education. I feel as though my knowledge has already broadened. I have struggled and I still
                do. The coding of the assignment was difficult, although we had all the code we needed, it was getting everything altered
                to how I needed it. This is something I have never been familiar about.
