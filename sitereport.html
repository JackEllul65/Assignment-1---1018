            <h1>Site Report</h1>
            <h1>19/12/20 - My knowledge</h1>
            <p> At the start of this module, I had near to none experience of coding. The only knowledge I had of coding was what I have already googled
                in my spare time during my year off of education. I feel as though my knowledge has already broadened. I have struggled and I still
                do. The coding of the assignment was difficult, although we had all the code we needed, it was getting everything altered
                to how I needed it. This is something I have never been familiar about. 
            </p>
            <h1> 22/12/20 - The beggining</h1>
            <p>After having 2 days of prepping for the assignment,this was the first day that I set towards starting this Assignment.
                I started by tryong to get my positioning of the page correct. trying to use the Grid layout. However, this provided me with
                complications. For starters, my layout seemed to not be working, as where i added back ground colours, there were none.
                But I did manage to title my home page withou and issue.
            </p>
            <h1>23/12/20 - Page layout</h1>
            <p>trying to fix the grid layout, i was forgetting to allocate locations of the page to where i labelled
                them to on the grid layout. So i now have a page, fully colored with a title. I will add some body 
                to my home page, and try to work out some sort of menu. 
                
            </p>
            <h1>27/12/20 - Menus</h1>
            <p>After hours of re-watching lectures, after hours of struggling to get a menu complete, It has now concluded.
                there is no animation to it as of yet. but there is a list, which links to other pages. I will focus on 
                creating the other pages as well as making this an animated menu. 
            </p>
            <h1>28/12/20 - responsive</h1>
            <p>I have now completed all 5 pages, as well as the 2 css files, for mobile and for desktop. The menus still need work 
                as they are not animated yet. Furthermore, the mobile css file is empty, i have solely focused on the 
                desktop so far, looking to complete that before i start with mobile. 
            </p>
            <h1>05/01/21 - attempting mobile css</h1>
            <p>I have completed all the pages. However, only the desktop css is working, as the mobile css file is empty.
                all pages have been filled out, and in working order alongside the desktop css file. I will now aim to compelte the mobile css 
                file to make it responsive.
            </p>
            <h1>10/01/21 - mobile</h1>
            <p>I have completed the different layout and navigation for the mobile css page. The menu for the mobile css is what took the longest.
                I attempted several different ways, however have had to stick to basic as I have not been successfull with any 
                other menu designs.
            </p>

            <h1>13/01/21 - details</h1>
            <p>All information and detail has been added into the website. I have been completing the site reports, C.V is complete, 
                there is an email form that will redirect them to their email, along with a place holder portfolio.
            </p>
            <h1>15/01/21 - Menu for Desktop</h1>
            <p>I have altered the menu for the desktop version, due to beinng very instant and honestly, not very aesthetic.
                As it was just a list whcih linked elsewhere. It now has animation to it, making it that little bit more
                 aesthetic.
            </p>
            <h1>17/01/21 - Major set back</h1>
            <p>
                Having to alter the menu to make them look nicer was challenging, however managed to complete this. 
                However, regarding GitHub, it is something that I missed in the assignment brief. Although I understand compeltely
                 on how it works, it is something I missed. So I have gone back and compelted re-writing my website while comitting.

        <aside>
            <p>Here is where I will talk about things that i came across while compelting Assignment 1, and the others to come.
                It will include my set backs, confusions and much more.
